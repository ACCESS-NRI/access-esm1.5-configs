  ACCESS-ESM1.5 global coupled model configuration running in co2 concentration driven mode under time varying historical (1850-2014) forcings, as described in Ziehn et al. (2020), https://doi.org/10.1071/ES19035.
  Historical forcing data including atmospheric co2 concentrations are primarily sourced from UKMO versions of CMIP6 inputs, with land use change data adapted from the Land-Use Harmonisation 2 (LUH2) dataset developed for CMIP6 (Hurtt et al. 2017), https://doi.org/10.22033/ESGF/input4MIPs.1127.
